# Hey! Nice to meet you.

Hey! I'm Jake. I'm a data nerd.

I'm a data scientist.

This website is meant to be a portfolio of all of my side projects and some of my work and school projects. It'll also have a bunch of my notes about data science, business, and life in general. And finally, it'll have a bit of my musings and weird thoughts.

I'm always open to messages. I'm open to mentor, or be mentored. I'm interested in collaborations, freelance work, startups, and whatever else you have in mind.

You can email me, find me on LinkedIn, or slide into my DM's on Instagram.
