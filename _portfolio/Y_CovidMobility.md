## Covid Mobility

Google recently published global mobility reports to illustrate how quarantine has impacted our lives and the places we frequent. You can find a link to the reports below. 

While very interesting, the reports weren't terribly easy to compare or review in aggregate, so I went ahead and made the below graph with Google's own Data Studio. 

Use the dropdown in the top left to select your state and see how your state's countyâ€™s activity has changed compared to how it usually is.

Bars are colored by topic as indicated at the top.

If a colored bar is pointing to the left, that means activity for this topic has decreased. If the colored bar points to the right, that means activity has increased. Hovering over the data will give you details on the exact percent change.

Here are some basic trends that I noticed in my home state of Arizona:
 - As expected, workplaces saw massive decreases in every county and so did most Retail & Recreation areas, which is good to see
 - All counties saw increases in Residential (because peeps are staying home)
 - There seemed to be an exodus into less densely populated counties, particularly Navajo and Coconino, which saw large spikes in Parks and Transit. Those counties contain most of the state's national parks so I guess it shows that a lot more people are seeing the Grand Canyon (I'm all about that)
