## GME Short Squeeze

It was the short squeeze heard round the world and it was the world's introduction to r/wallstreetbets. After it seemed like the craziness of 2020 was subsiding, the financial markets went into turmoil after seemingly being taken hostage by a bunch of redditors, and "diamond hands" and "tendies" became a part of the modern lexicon.

While I can't say that I made major tendies on GME, I found the whole situation fascinating. In the midst of all the hoopla, naturally people made some datasets about GME and the content of Reddit and threw them up on Kaggle.

I was able to create a quick viz to illustrate the hype and how the number of GME stock mentions in the subreddit rose in tandem with its stock price. Not much analysis to do on this one, and, in fact, the correlation is pretty self-explanatory. Its a nice illustration of a fascinating moment in history, nonetheless.

I will say though, that how well the data correlates is pretty satisfying.

Whether you believe it's right or not, I find it to be an interesting visualization on the power of the collective and how a bunch of like minded apes (their words, not mine) with diamond hands can play ball with finance behemoths.
